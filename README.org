#+TITLE: README

study.wranger R package for tidying data in a way compatible with VEuPathDB workflows for EDA loading.


* Install in existing R environment or RStudio

#+BEGIN_SRC R
# Install Bioconductor packages
install.packages("BiocManager") # if not already installed
BiocManager::install(c("SummarizedExperiment", "DESeq2"))

# Install remotes package
install.packages("remotes") # if you don't already have 'remotes'
library(remotes)

# Install the study-wrangler package from GitHub
remotes::install_github("VEuPathDB/study-wrangler@v1.0.11", upgrade_dependencies = FALSE)
library(study.wrangler)

# Now go to the vignettes directory in RStudio and learn how to use it
#+END_SRC



* To build a docker image

#+begin_example
docker build -t veupathdb/study-wrangler .
#+end_example

Build notes:
- add `--progress=plain` if you want to see the errors more easily
- each `remotes::install_github()` command in the Dockerfile eats into a rate limit for anonymous users at GitHub (60 per hour!) - so if you are playing around with things you almost certainly will hit the limit
- setting up credentials for a higher limit seems not worth the cost

To run in docker:
#+begin_example
docker run --rm -ti -e PASSWORD=password -p 8989:8787 veupathdb/study-wrangler
# Then in your web browser navigate to localhost:8989 and login with "rstudio" and "password"
#+end_example

To add R functions to the repo (using docker):
#+begin_example
docker run --rm -ti -v $PWD:/study.wrangler -e PASSWORD=password -p 8888:8787 veupathdb/study-wrangler
# Then in your web browser navigate to localhost:8888 and login with "rstudio" and "password"

# at the RStudio prompt
> library(devtools)
# then in the file browser:
# 1. navigate into ./study.wrangler directory
# 2. Set As Working Directory (gear icon in file browser)
# 3. (or do `setwd("~/study.wrangler")` in console)
> devtools::test()
# actually just `test()` will work

# If running commands in console, you will need to do
> load_all()
# after making changes in the code.

# To update the documentation and/or NAMESPACE file
> document()
> build(path='dist')
> install()
# Note that we are not committing the man/*.Rd files to the repo at the moment
#+end_example
